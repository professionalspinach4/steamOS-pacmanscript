This is a simple script that automates the setup process for installing arch packages. 
Open Konsole in whatever folder you saved this file to and run the command "bash ./pacman.sh"
Feel free to edit the script to remove the passwaord setup section if you already have one setup, or for re-running the script after system updates. 
You will lose your installed packages on system updates so make a list of what you've installed or create a simple script to re-install them. 
I just tested this on a fresh system update, so you should have no issues running this. If anything changes in future updates, I'll edit the script accordingly. 
Enjoy!
